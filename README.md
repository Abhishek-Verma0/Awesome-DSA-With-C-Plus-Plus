# DSA with C++

Welcome to **DSA with C++**, a repository documenting my journey through learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. This repo serves as both a personal log and a resource for others who are also embarking on a similar path. The code here includes various implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, as well as explanations and notes on key concepts.

## Motivation

I created this repository to track my progress in mastering DSA concepts and their C++ implementations. By documenting my learning process and sharing my code, I hope to:

- Strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Create a portfolio of my work that reflects my growth and journey.
- Provide a resource that others can use as a reference.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into folders based on the following categories:

1. **Arrays & Strings**: Basic operations, searching, sorting, and manipulation of arrays and strings.
2. **Linked Lists**: Single, doubly, and circular linked lists, and operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
3. **Stacks & Queues**: Implementation of stack and queue using arrays and linked lists, and problem-solving techniques.
4. **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversals.
5. **Graphs**: Graph representations, BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms.
6. **Sorting Algorithms**: Insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, and other comparison-based sorting techniques.
7. **Dynamic Programming**: Solving optimization problems using dynamic programming approaches.
8. **Greedy Algorithms**: Solutions to optimization problems using greedy methods.
9. **Other Topics**: Bit manipulation, hashing, backtracking, and more.

Each folder includes:

- **Code**: C++ implementations of the respective data structure or algorithm.
- **Notes**: A markdown file explaining the concept, approach, and any nuances in understanding.
- **Practice Problems**: Selected problems from online platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or others, along with their solutions.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: All implementations and exercises are written in C++.
- **Git**: Version control to track my progress and changes.

## How to Use This Repository
